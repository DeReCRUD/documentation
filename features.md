## <a name="future"></a> Future Features

TDB, but here is some thinking.  More exploration is needed about what
open source components exist that we can leverage.

* JavaScript library for validating an object using your schema
* Node.js development server for defining your schema (saved as text

* Node.js production server for hosting REST APIs and UIs based on your
    schema.
* AngularJS UI for editing objects of a given schema.
